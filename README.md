# Front End Web Development - Restaurant Reviews App
---

## Overview: Restaurant Review App Stage 1

For the **Restaurant Reviews** project, I have converted a static webpage into a fully responsive mobile web application that was optimized for performance, accessibility, and offline access.

**Live Demo** [Click Here](https://clane72.github.io/)

### Getting Started

The started code is forked from Udacity for a restaurant reviews website.
The original project work is enhanced in three areas:
- Responsive Design
- Accessibility
- Offline Use

## How to launch the app locally?
To run this example you'll need to use a local server. The easiest way to do so is to use the chrome extension but
you can launch the local http server using python as well. Please follow the steps mentioned below:

* Using Python HTTP server
In the project folder, start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer. Python has some simple tools to do this, and you don't even need to know Python. For most people, it's already installed on your computer.

* In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.

## Leaflet.js and Mapbox:

This repository uses [leafletjs](https://leafletjs.com/) with [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/). You need to replace `mapboxToken:` with a token from [Mapbox-Access token](https://www.mapbox.com/help/how-access-tokens-work/) in `main.js and restaurant_info.js`. Mapbox is free to use, and does not require any payment information.
